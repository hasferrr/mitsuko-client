## Scale your global reach with streamlined language localization

Reaching a global audience is table stakes. The real challenge is scaling language localization without extending timelines or budgets. Mitsuko.app helps studios move from raw media to publish‑ready subtitles in 100+ languages — fast, consistent, and human‑sounding.

### Why scaling language localization is hard

- Fragmented tools and hand‑offs across transcription, translation, editing, and export
- Format friction between SRT, ASS, and VTT
- Manual transcription that slows every project
- Terminology drift and inconsistent tone across episodes or seasons
- Review bottlenecks that push launches back

### How Mitsuko helps

1. Accurate transcription with precise timestamps, ready for subtitle editing
2. Format‑ready import/export for SRT, ASS, and VTT
3. 100+ languages powered by leading AI models; add human review where you need it
4. Batch workflows and project tracking: drag‑and‑drop files, translate many at once, see progress at a glance
5. Consistency and control: share context across files and add custom instructions for tone, names, and terminology

### Results you can expect

- Faster global premieres and day‑and‑date releases
- Lower language localization spend per title
- Stable brand voice across markets
- New markets unlocked with minimal overhead

### A simple studio workflow

1. Drop your SRT/ASS/VTT or media files into Mitsuko
2. Transcribe audio into clean, time‑aligned subtitles
3. Translate into target languages (100+) and apply project instructions for tone and terms
4. Review or spot‑check, then fine‑tune phrasing if needed
5. Export in the formats your platforms or partners require
