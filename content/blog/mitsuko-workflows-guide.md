Batch processing and translation workflows require both strategic planning and technical efficiency. This guide combines essential techniques for optimal Mitsuko usage.

## Getting Started With Translations
Begin your translation journey with these foundational steps:

1. **Create a project**
   - Start from the dashboard and name your project
   - Create new translation and extraction

2. **Import source files**
   - Drag/drop SRT, ASS, or VTT files
   - Maintain episode chronology through ordering

3. **Extract context documents**
   - Select subtitle file to extract context from
   - Reuse previous context to generate the new context document

4. **Configure translation settings**
   - Set source/target languages
   - Configure model and temperature
   - Import context document for terminology consistency
   - Add custom instruction if needed

5. **Execute translation**
   - Monitor real-time progress
   - Pause/resume as needed

6. **Review and export**
   - Edit results before exporting
   - Choose preferred subtitle format
   - Combine original and translated text for quality assurance

## Data Preparation Essentials
Clean file names prevent workflow issues and accelerates processing:

### Bulk Rename Episodes
- **Sequential numbering**
  Apply start values, step increments, and zero-padding
- **Pattern removal**
  Strip unnecessary prefixes/suffixes
- **Regex replacements**
  Use global/case-insensitive flags for standardization
- **Validation**
  Always preview changes before applying

> Pro Tip: Consistent naming saves hours in batch operations

## Advanced Batch Processing
Scale efficiently while maintaining control:

### Strategy
- Group related episodes to maximize context reuse
- Maintain naming conventions for traceability

### Export Practices
- Generate ZIP archives for handoff
- Maintain batch-specific changelogs

## Global Defaults Configuration
Standardize workflows across teams:

### Key Benefits
- Enforce consistent models/prompts
- Reduce per-project setup time
- Prevent configuration drift

### Implementation
1. Set baseline parameters in Global Defaults
2. New projects automatically inherit settings
3. Make project-specific overrides only when essential
4. Propagate updates centrally to all teams

## Conclusion
Master your translation workflow by:
1. Starting with clean, well-named files
2. Using batch processing for scalable operations
3. Enforcing standards through Global Defaults
4. Monitoring performance and costs

These integrated techniques ensure fast, predictable, and maintainable translation workflows at any scale.
