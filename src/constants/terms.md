# Terms of Service

Last Updated: 08/06/2025

## 1.  Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Mitsuko AI Subtitle Translator web application ("Mitsuko," "we," "us," or "our"), you ("you" or "User") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use Mitsuko.

## 2.  Description of Service

Mitsuko is an AI-powered web application designed to translate subtitle files, analyze and extract contextual meaning from subtitles, and convert audio content into text. Mitsuko utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning models to provide translations. The service is provided "as is" and "as available."

## 3.  User Conduct

You agree to use Mitsuko only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of Mitsuko. Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Uploading or transmitting any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.
* Uploading content you do not own or lack necessary rights/permissions to use.
* Uploading or transmitting any content that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.
* Impersonating any person or entity, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity.
* Attempting to gain unauthorized access to Mitsuko's servers or network.
* Using Mitsuko for any commercial purpose without our express prior written consent, unless permitted by the applicable open-source license (GNU General Public License v3.0).
* Reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling any portion of Mitsuko, except as permitted by the applicable open-source license.
* Interfering with or disrupting the operation of Mitsuko or the servers or networks connected to Mitsuko.

## 4.  Intellectual Property

The Mitsuko software is open-source and licensed under the GNU GPLv3, which allows you to freely use, modify, and share the code (available on GitHub) as long as you follow the license terms. When you upload content (like subtitle files), you keep ownership but grant Mitsuko a non-exclusive, worldwide license to process and translate it solely to operate the service. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Mitsuko and any uploaded content complies with applicable laws.

## 5. Refund Policy

Purchases of subscription plans and credits are final and non-refundable. Credits are consumed based on usage within the application as described in the service documentation. All purchased credits remain valid for one year or as otherwise specified from the date of purchase, after which any unused credits will expire. Subscription plans provide access for the agreed billing cycle. We currently do not offer refunds for any purchased credits or active/past subscription periods.

## 6.  Disclaimer of Warranties

Mitsuko is provided “as is” with no guarantees of accuracy, reliability, or uninterrupted service. We explicitly disclaim all warranties, including fitness for a specific purpose or non-infringement. Translations are AI-generated and may contain errors; you’re responsible for verifying their correctness. We do not promise the service will be secure, error-free, or free of harmful components like viruses.

## 7.  Limitation of Liability

Mitsuko and its team will not be held liable for any damages (direct, indirect, or consequential) arising from your use of the service, including losses from errors, interruptions, or reliance on translations. This applies even if we’ve been advised of potential risks. Some jurisdictions limit liability exclusions, so this section may not apply fully in your region.

## 8.  Privacy

Your use of Mitsuko is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.

## 9.  Modifications to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will post the updated Terms on the Mitsuko website, and the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms will be revised. Your continued use of Mitsuko after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 10. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to Mitsuko immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the service provider’s jurisdiction, and any legal disputes will be resolved under those laws.
